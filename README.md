# RTK Query Integration in React

This project demonstrates how to efficiently integrate **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)** in a React application for handling data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server.

---

## 📌 What is RTK Query?

RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool that comes with Redux Toolkit. It helps simplify API integration by:

- Automating network request management
- Providing auto caching and re-fetching
- Minimizing the need for writing reducers, actions, and boilerplate code

---

## 🚀 Features

- Built-in support for queries and mutations
- Auto caching, re-fetching, and invalidation
- Optimistic updates and automated loading/error states
- TypeScript support
- Easily extendable and customizable

## 🧩 Folder Structure

src/

├── app/               # Redux store configuration

├── features/     

 │   ├── api/           # RTK Query API slice

 │   └── users/         # Feature-specific logic (optional)

├── components/        # Reusable UI components

└── App.tsx            # Root component of the application

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Create an API Slice** using `createApi` and define your endpoints.
2. **Add the API middleware and reducer** to your Redux store.
3. **Use auto-generated hooks** like `useGetUsersQuery()` in your components.
4. RTK Query handles:
   - Fetching
   - Caching
   - Loading/error state
   - Re-fetching when needed

## ✅ Benefits of Using RTK Query

- Reduces boilerplate code
- Centralized API logic
- Auto state management for API requests
- Works seamlessly with Redux DevTools
- Excellent for scalable applications
